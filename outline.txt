Chapter 1
We meet Nick, Tom, Daisy, and jordan.

When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things
would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and
Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.
